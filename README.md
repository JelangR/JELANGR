## Hi there üëã
My name is **Jelang Ramadhan** <br>
I am well-versed in data analysis, modeling, and visualization. I have a strong command of programming languages such as Python and R, along with experience using SQL, Tableau, and Metabase. I am also proficient in machine learning frameworks like scikit-learn and TensorFlow. I enjoy translating complex datasets into actionable insights and have consistently demonstrated strong communication skills when presenting findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I aim to grow my career by solving real-world problems through data-driven decision-making.
